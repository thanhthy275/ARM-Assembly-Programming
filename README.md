Development Stages

**Stage 1 is concerned with some basic functions, comparisons and arithmetic.** It is in three stages

- Stage 1A - the min function  
Write ARM assembly code for the function stage1a_min that returns the smallest value of 3 numbers given as arguments. In addition you should note the following:

- Stage 1B - the max function  (10% of total marks)
Write ARM assembly code for the function stage1b_max that returns the largest value of 3 numbers given as arguments. In addition you should note the following:

- Stage 1C  - the diff function (10% of total marks)
Write ARM assembly code for the function stage1C_diff that returns the difference between the smallest and largest of 3 numbers given as arguments. In addition you should note the following:

**Stage 2 - flash an array of integers**
Write ARM assembly code for the function stage2_flash_array that sequentially flashes an LED connected to GPIO18 to show each value in the array input array.    Your function should insert short delays for each individual flash, and a longer pause (of no more than 2 seconds) between each number's flash sequence. You are encouraged to use the FLASH and PAUSE functions in the resource zip file to implement this.

**Stage 3 - sort function using "bubblesort algorithm"**
Write ARM assembly code for the function stage3_bubblesort that takes an input array of 32-bit positive integers and produces an array of sorted numbers by implementing the "bubble sort" sorting algorithm links to an external site.
